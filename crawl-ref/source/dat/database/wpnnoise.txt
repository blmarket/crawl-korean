# The SINGING SWORD
#
###############################################################################
###############################################################################
#
# The Sword operates in three modes: no tension, low tension, high tension.
#
# No tension:
# Speech is very rare, soft (does not wake up monsters), bored or witty,
# sometimes just chatty. The sword is rational, sometimes introspective.
# It is somewhat educated (mostly about music and war) and likes to show off.
#
# Low tension:
# Speech is common, somewhat loud (do wake up nearby monsters) and slightly
# damages everyone in sight. The sword is calm and cool. It enjoys the
# bloodshed, but is sane. Of course, work is more fun with a little tune...
#
# High tension:
# Speech is very common, extremely loud (you may use CAPS) and does more
# damage. Messages are insane, the sword is out of control.
# At high tension, the sword may SCREAM, doing even more damage.
#
#
# Generally, the Sword is arrogant: it sees itself as the main hero, with the
# wielder just being a disposable tool/fool. Also, it does not like allies --
# all the fame belong to our steely hero!
#
# There are some (occasionally modified) lines from actual songs. Those are
# okay to use, but particularly rare.
#
# There are the following types of messages:
# * singing (including composing)
# * speaking
# * real songs (one liners from actual songs, sometimes modified)
# * instruments    -- also used for all noisy randarts
# * weapon noises  -- the no tension ones used for noisy randarts
# * chatter        -- also used for all noisy randarts
#
#                 no tension      low tension       high tension     (old)
#
# none            1000             100               10
# some speech       7                7                7
