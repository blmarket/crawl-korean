# Glass vaults
#
# Single instances of serial_glass vaults can be placed normally, so
# we only roll numbers between 2 and 12 (non-flat distribution).
# Sometimes we add a few rarer glass vaults to the level.
#
# The maps for this serial vault are in mini_features.des and can
# also be used individually.
