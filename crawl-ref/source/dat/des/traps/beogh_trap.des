# Trap: Beogh Altar
##############################################################################

# By sevenhm.
# There are many monsters (Ogres / Trolls / etc) on the lava islands. There is
# a very good item sitting on the pressure plate trap.  When you stand on the
# trap, Beogh rages that you would steal the items that were left for him by
# worshippers, and creates lava bridges so that the monsters can leave the
# island and run towards you.
# If you are a worshipper of his, or if you are a godless Orc he asks you to
# approach the altar, and does not open the bridge.
