Dungeon

It is still a mystery how this bizarre place was created. Some claim that it
is the playground of bored gods, whereas others maintain that it was shaped
by all kinds of species who fled the overworld and shunned the light.
No matter what the origin of this cave is, it is filled with riches unheard
of as well as with ample dangers to any intruder. Few have escaped alive,
and even fewer have kept some sliver of sanity to tell the tale.

The dungeon is 27 levels deep, but, honestly, this is only the beginning.
%%%%
Temple

A Temple of Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the insanity of the
dungeon. It is located between the levels 4 and 7 of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Orcish Mines

오크들의 광산으로, 금화들로 가득하다. 하지만, 내부는 겉보기와 달리 위험하고 갇히기 쉽다. 오크 광산은 총 4층으로 구성되어 있고, 엘프의 방으로 이어지는 입구가 존재한다.
%%%%
Elven Halls

Whereas most elven folk would never move into a dark subterranean complex
like this, the deep elves did. Their halls are filled with riches, but any
passers-by should be aware of the legendary magical prowess of this species.

The Elven Halls are three levels deep.
%%%%
Dwarven Hall

These halls of finely worked stone are the dwelling of the Deep Dwarves.
Their fine metalworking skills allowed them to forge enough weapons against
the likes of you.

It is but a single level.
%%%%
Lair

Most adventurers find the Lair of Beasts to be an exciting change of
climate. And indeed, there is something to be said about getting gored,
mauled and eaten rather than sliced, burnt or stabbed.

The Lair is eight levels deep and contains the stairs to three more branches.
%%%%
Swamp

A swampy wasteland, complete with ooze, muck, flies and large slavering carnivorous monsters.

The Swamp is five levels deep and contains the decaying rune.
A dungeon features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches.
If the Swamp is present, the entrance is located between Lair:2 and Lair:5.
%%%%
Shoals

From afar you hear the steady sounds of waves and smell the salty spray.
Upon reaching the Shoals, you are impressed by exotic underground beaches,
making up a few islands in a vast sea. All of a sudden, a bloodcurdling
scream fills the air, followed by a gurgle. Anxiously, you look around and
wonder: Who is the predator? And who is the prey?

The Shoals are five levels deep and contain the barnacled rune.
A dungeon features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches.
If the Shoals are present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Snake Pit

Home of the serpent, lair of the naga.

The Snake Pit is five levels deep and contains the serpentine rune.
A dungeon features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches.

%%%%
Spider Nest

And you thought you'll just wield a shoe and be done? If you don't have
arachnophobia yet, you will soon.

A dungeon features only two of the Snake Pit, Swamp, Shoals and Spider Nest branches.
If the Spider Nest is present, the entrance is located between Lair:3 and Lair:6.
%%%%
Slime Pits

The amorphous realm of acids, jellies and slimes. Any trace of intelligent
beings has long been dissolved. Still, there are rumours of great treasures
deep down, hidden safely away in secret chambers without door or window for
acid to leak in.

The Slime Pits are six levels deep and contain the slimy rune.
The entry is between Lair:6 and Lair:8.
%%%%
Vaults

Possibly constructed by some powerful madman, the Vaults are said to be home
to great treasures. The blood spots all around the entrance indicate that
there is a certain amount of violence, too.

The Vaults are eight levels deep and contain the silver rune.
The entrance can be found between levels 14 and 19 of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Hall of Blades

Once upon a time, all the daggers and axes and polearms would gather at the
time of night and dance the waltz, dreaming of battlefields void of man and
beast. That time is no more, yet the weapons are still there.

The Hall of Blades is a single level and can be found between Vault:4 and Vault:6.
%%%%
Crypt

말로 형언할 수 없는 일로 고통받는 영혼들의 신음과 비명이 들려오는 곳이다. 납골당은 총 5층으로 구성되어 있고, 보물창고 2~4층 사이에서 납골당으로 이어지는 입구를 찾을 수 있다.
%%%%
Tomb

The Tomb of the Ancients, a place of damnation, of horrors animated by the vilest necromancy.

The Tomb is three levels deep and contains the golden rune.
Its entry is either on Crypt:2 or Crypt:3.
%%%%
Hell

The hallway to the four hells is guarded by Geryon. Heroes who prove their
worth in the vestibule and blow Geryon's horn may explore the different
regions of Hell: Dis, Gehenna, Cocytus and Tartarus.

Portals to the Vestibule of Hell are found abundantly in the deeper parts of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Dis

The Iron City of Dis. Who will stand the test of iron?

Dis is seven levels deep and contains the iron rune.
It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Gehenna

The fires of Gehenna burnt many a confident hero, and they will burn evermore.

Gehenna is seven levels deep and contains the obsidian rune.
It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Cocytus

A grim and frost-bitten wasteland.

Cocytus is seven levels deep and contains the icy rune.
It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Tartarus

A decaying netherworld. Over time, the undead, demons and devils of this
place drain all life out of treasure-craving visitors.

Tartarus is seven levels deep and contains the bone rune.
It can be accessed via the Vestibule of Hell.
%%%%
Zot

A region of the dungeon complex, safely locked away and referred to usually
by madness, frenzy, lunacy. Only the most demented adventurers would dare to
break the seal and press deeper - in the vain hope for a fabled artefact no
one has ever laid eyes on before.

The Realm of Zot is five levels deep and can only be entered when carrying at least three runes.
%%%%
Forest

Tha trees be attackin'!
%%%%
Abyss

The Abyss is a truly bizarre place, ever-changing and twisted.
It is filled with all sorts of monsters, mostly of demonic nature,
whose common aim is to feast on intruders.
It is also the garbage dump for many sorcerers, who delight in sending
would-be champions like you to these proving grounds of madness.
Reportedly, there is some structure to the chaos, as Lugonu seems to concoct
schemes around this place and its denizens.

The abyssal rune can be found there.
The Abyss can be purposefully reached through portals in the deeper levels of the main dungeon.
%%%%
Pandemonium

Pandemonium is an infinite realm of pain and suffering. While you can find a
good deal of loot there, all these treasures are guarded by demons and even
crueller demon lords. Many a hero, confusing confidence with megalomania,
has died unsuspectingly in the barrage of torment and hellfire.

Pandemonium is endless. Portals there are found abundantly in the deeper
parts of the main dungeon. Note that getting back might be more difficult.

You can find no less than five runes in the Pandemonium:
 • fiery in the well-heated realm of Cerebov
 • glowing in the radioactive domain on Mnoleg
 • magical is guarded by arcane powers of Lom Lobon and his minions
 • dark lies in the shadowy dwelling of Gloorx Vloq
 • demonic runes exist in multiple copies, owned by less famous lords
%%%%
Ziggurat

A series of arenas, each containing greater wealth and even greater danger
than the last. Whatever entity created this monstrosity charges a steep
price for entry. Beware, for a ziggurat is not a place for the faint of
heart: even the bravest and most skilled adventurers have met their ends in
one. While a portal to safety will be present on every level, once left, a
ziggurat cannot be reentered.
%%%%
Labyrinth

The Labyrinth is a vast and complex maze designed by subtle and malicious
minds for reasons long lost to history. Old stories say that the labyrinth
was constructed as a prison for a fearsome minotaur. More recent stories say
this beast dwells there still, guarding the labyrinth's sole exit — as well
as a hoard of treasure taken from the bodies of the foolish adventurers who
got lost inside and starved to death. Take care inside the shifting,
twisting passages of this labyrinth, or your own possessions may end up in
the minotaur's treasure pile.
%%%%
Bazaar

Aside from the vendors who've set up their stores at various places in the
dungeon, there are others trying to make a living by traveling from place
to place. Bazaars feature a number of different shops and often have
better stock than the sedentary ones, sometimes even at a bargain.

Also, be warned that their nomadic lifestyle has taught these sellers to
appropriate any items an adventurer might leave behind, and then leave
quickly, probably to sell them elsewhere.
%%%%
Trove

Once upon a time, an enterprising thief and wizard, terrified of being
caught committing an act of burglary, created a system of portals leading
into the secret treasure troves and chambers of the rich. Too scared to loot
them himself, he instead charged an extortionate fee for entry to anyone who
wanted to rifle through them. A clever artificer, he designed his portals to
direct the entrant to the trove most suited to their needs.

The items inside this trove are likely to be useful, but beware: the wizard
is long dead, and even while alive he never offered a money-back guarantee.
%%%%
Sewer

Every settlement brings forth the unpleasant sewers and drains, ignored by
most but hideaways for others. Old tales speak of dangerous creatures,
bathing in disgusting-smelling green water, preying on each other without
mercy. The tales also allude to valuable items left by daring and
unfortunate visitors, left to grow mildew in the damp caverns.
%%%%
Ossuary

A small tomb, containing the remains of some distant relatives of the
pharaohs. It is undoubtedly home to many traps, and its denizens are
unlikely to take kindly to looting.
%%%%
Bailey

The castle of some lord. It is undoubtedly protected by physical barriers
and well-trained soldiers.
%%%%
Ice Cave

A desolate, echo-filled cavern shaped from solid ice. The intricate carvings
and statues which once lined its walls have been warped and obscured by
centuries of slow melting and refreezing.
%%%%
Volcano

Built from enormous blocks of obsidian, this sweltering chamber may once
have served as a temple to some strange deity, or perhaps the dwelling of a
mighty fire giant. The air shimmers with oppressive heat, and the dull roar
of the volcano's heart never ceases.
%%%%
Wizlab

The laboratory of some wizard, the portal to which has been carelessly left
open. Beware, for wizards love to guard their possessions with traps and
monsters of their own making!
%%%%
Hive

You hear a manifold buzzing.
