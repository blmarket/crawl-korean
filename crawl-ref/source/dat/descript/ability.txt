Breathe Sticky Flame

Breathe a blast of sticky flame at a targeted monster. As the name suggests,

Bat Form

Turn into a speedy vampire bat. In bat form, you can neither interact with
items in any form (except picking them up or dropping them), nor cast spells.
Note that Bat Form will decrease your current Strength while increasing your
Dexterity. Thus, you won't be able to change form if your Strength is too low.
The flight is magically augmented, so you will stay in the air even if the
weight of your possessions or some disability would normally drag you down.
%%%%
Bottle Blood

At experience level 6 and higher, Vampires can bottle the blood from non-rotten
and blood-containing corpses they are standing on. Doing so requires the

Evoke Berserk Rage

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your hit points
and damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill
anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot
perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff
something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually
followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, cannot
berserk again, and occasionally even pass out.

longer to trigger than uncontrolled ones.

# Zin(진)
Recite

Preach to monsters about Zin's laws, which can lead to various results. There
are four books you can preach from:

* Book of Abominations: This book deals with the very thing most abhorrent to
Zin — chaos in all its forms. These recitations will invoke Zin's most powerful
smiting.

* Book of Ablutions: The impure are nearly as loathed by the Law-Giver.
Recitations from this book will deal damage to such creatures.

* Book of Apostates: Intelligent creatures who do not worship Zin but do no
other evil will be dealt with least harshly. The recitations from this book
merely sow confusion. Yet those who dare to worship a god alien to Zin may be
permanently deprived of means to spread their foul faith.

* Book of Anathema: Demons and the undead are hated by Zin. This book gives you
means to rebuke them.
%%%%
Vitalisation

Vitalise yourself, gaining divine stamina and sustenance from Zin. Divine
stamina protects you from sickness, poisoning, petrification, confusion and
rot, and temporarily boosts and sustains your Strength, Intelligence and
Dexterity.
%%%%
Imprison

Temporarily imprison a monster in walls of silver. The duration of the prison
is increased by Invocations skill.
%%%%
Sanctuary

For a short duration gain safety in a divine refuge. While you are inside the
sanctuary, monsters will not attack you, but the protection will disappear at
once should you breach the divine peace.
%%%%
Cure All Mutations

Cure all your mutations — but only once.
%%%%
# The Shining One(샤이닝 원)
Divine Shield

The Shining One grants you a divine shield. Because it is held aloft by godly
power, it does not interfere with your equipment. However, it is controlled by
your willpower, and your skill with Shields will improve it.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame

Invoke a huge blast of divine fury centered on you, severely damaging undead
and demons. All other hostiles also take damage, if less so, whereas you and
your allies are never affected.
%%%%
Summon Divine Warrior

Summon an angel or daeva, powerful warriors against evil. They may be blessed
by the Shining One to stay longer in this world.
%%%%
# Kikubaaqudgha (키쿠바쿠드하)
Receive Corpses

Create one or more reanimatable monster corpses near yourself. The number and
freshness of these are dependent on Necromancy skill.
%%%%
Torment

Sacrifice a cadaver to make everyone in sight, including you, experience all
the pain that being suffered in its life. This will decimate the resilience of
all those who can feel it.

Kikubaaqudgha may choose to protect you from it... or may not.
%%%%
# Yredelemnul(이레데넴눌)
Animate Remains

Reanimate a single corpse or skeleton as a follower. Note that zombies and
skeletons cannot leave the level they were created on.

surroundings.
%%%%
Injury Mirror

%%%%
Drain Life

주변 적들의 생명력을 흡수하여, 당신의 것으로 만든다. 
%%%%
Enslave Soul

Mark a living intelligent monster's soul as ripe for the taking. Once the
marked monster dies, its soul will be yours.

The enslaved soul will retain the monster's faculties, equipment and abilities,
as well as some of its innate healing. However, only a relatively uninjured
monster can have its soul marked, and only one soul can be enslaved at a time.
Furthermore, the duration of the mark is dependent on Invocations skill.

Note that enslaved souls can follow you beyond the level they were created on.
%%%%
Animate Remains or Dead

If you get this description, it is a bug.
%%%%
# Okawaru(오카와루)
Heroism

Temporarily increase all of your combat skills, including the ability to sneak
around or avoid traps.
%%%%
Finesse

Greatly increase your combat speed, with no loss of accuracy. This unnatural
effect causes small amounts of magic contamination, prolonged exposure to which
may be bad for your health.
%%%%

Minor Destruction

대상이 된 적을, 임의의 파괴 마법으로 공격한다.

Forget Spell

# Trog(트로그)
Burn Spellbooks

Set all spellbooks within your field of vision on fire. The fire is fuelled by
Trog's hatred, and Trog likes it most when you don't even care which books of
madness burst into flames.
%%%%
Berserk

Go berserk. Going berserk greatly, if temporarily, increases your hit points
and damage output in melee fights. It will time out quickly if you don't kill
anything, but may be extended by multiple kills. While berserk, you cannot
perform a number of actions such as, for example, (un)wield a weapon, quaff
something, evoke wands or items, or cast spells. Such a rage is usually
followed by deep exhaustion, a time during which you are slowed down, and
cannot berserk again. Unlike other sources of rage, depending on your piety
Trog may occasionally prevent you from passing out.
%%%%
Trog's Hand

Invoke a powerful regeneration ability which stacks with all other sources and
even allows otherwise non-healing species to regenerate. This will also
increase protection from magical effects.
%%%%
Brothers in Arms

분노한 몬스터들이 소환되어, 당신의 편에 써서 함께 싸워 줄 것이다.
%%%%
# Elyvilon(엘라이빌론)
Divine Protection

Beseech Elyvilon to save your life. If you are mortally wounded, the Healer may
undo the killing blow. Especially pious individuals may be certain of this
help, but in that case, any actual intervention costs piety (as opposed to
merely asking for intervention, which is always free).

Beware: killing others while asking to be spared yourself is a major sin!
%%%%
Lesser Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a small
amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them neutral.
This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still worse on
other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless creatures
cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is asleep. The
chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food and magic point are
lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half the monster's
experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected
and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Lesser Self-Healing

기도술에 따라, 당신의 체력을 조금 회복한다.
%%%%
Purification

Purge your body of all bad effects such as sickness, poisoning, slowness,
petrification, confusion and rot, and fully restore your Strength, Dexterity
and Intelligence.
%%%%
Greater Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a creature other than you by a
moderate amount. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to make them
neutral. This works best on animals, worse on humanoids of your species, still
worse on other humanoids, and worst of all on demons and undead. Mindless
creatures cannot be pacified, and no monster can be pacified while it is
asleep. The chance for successful pacification depends on the healing power, so
it is significantly better than using Lesser Healing.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food, piety and magic
points are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half
the monster's experience value and possibly some piety. Otherwise, the monster
is unaffected and you gain nothing.

You can also heal allies and neutral monsters.
%%%%
Greater Self-Healing

Depending on your Invocations skill, heal a moderate amount of hit points.
Roughly, Greater Healing will allow you to heal three times the amount of
Lesser Healing at a slightly higher total piety cost.
%%%%
Divine Vigour

Depending on your Invocations skill, restore a large amount of, and temporarily
increase, both your hit points and your magic points.
%%%%
# Lugonu (루고누)
Depart the Abyss

어비스를 떠나, 원래 있던 곳으로 되돌아간다.
%%%%
Bend Space

Bend the fabric of space around you, instantly translocating you a small
distance, and possibly also translocating and damaging monsters in your
vicinity.
%%%%
Banish

적을 어비스로 추방시킨다.
%%%%
Corrupt

Corrupt the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will cause
the level to largely change appearance, and will gate in demons from the Abyss
bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already corrupted or
in the Abyss.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss

Transfer yourself to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health and magic depleted.
%%%%
# Nemelex Xobeh (네멜렉스 죠베)
Draw One

가지고 있는 카드 중 한 장을 뽑는다.
%%%%
Peek at Two

Discard one card from any deck in your inventory to draw two cards from the
deck, look at them, and shuffle them back into the deck. The deck will be
inscribed as containing those two cards, and, if they are different, this will
identify the deck.
%%%%
Triple Draw

Draw three cards from any deck in your inventory, look at them, and decide
which one to keep, discarding the other two.
%%%%
Deal Four

Deal four cards from any unmarked deck in the time it normally takes to draw a
single card. The rest of the deck is lost. If the deck does not contain enough
cards, Nemelex will give you one extra card, but you might not like it.
%%%%
Stack Five

Draw five cards from any unmarked deck in your inventory, losing the rest of
the deck. Look at the cards and sort them into any order you'd like.
Subsequently, you can draw these cards in the order you chose.
%%%%
# Beogh (베오그)
Smiting

Smite an enemy within your field of vision. This doesn't require a direct path,
just seeing the enemy is enough.
%%%%
Recall Orcish Followers

Recall your orcish followers from anywhere in the dungeon to your immediate
surroundings.
%%%%
Stop Recall

Stop recalling your followers.
%%%%
# Fedhas
Sunlight

Call sunlight down over a small area of the dungeon. Monsters illuminated by
the light will be easier to hit. Water affected by the sunlight will evaporate.
In particular, deep water will become shallow water, and shallow water will dry
up completely, revealing the dungeon floor.
%%%%
Growth

Use fruit to grow a ring of plants around yourself. If a complete ring cannot
be formed (because you do not have enough fruit), plants will grow on squares
adjacent to you that are close to monsters. The plants you create gain bonus HP
proportional to your Invocations skill.
%%%%
Rain

Cause rain to fall around yourself, turning the dungeon floor into shallow
water and shallow water into deep water. This is likely to allow plants and
mushrooms to grow in areas not directly drenched.
%%%%
Reproduction

Create giant spores from corpses in your line of sight. The spores will
explode, causing damage to you or your enemies.
%%%%
Evolution

Turn plants and fungi into stronger species. Upgrading fungi requires piety,
while upgrading plants requires fruit. Upgraded plants gain a bonus to attack
accuracy proportional to the user's Invocations skill, and oklob plants are
more likely to spit acid at higher Invocations.
%%%%
# Cheibriados
Bend Time

Attempt to slow down everyone adjacent to you. High Invocations skill makes it
harder to resist.
%%%%
Temporal Distortion

Warp the flow of time around you, causing monsters to skip forwards in time
relative to you.
%%%%
Slouch

Cause damage to everyone in sight who is moving faster than you. Those
magically hasted will be hurt particularly painfully.
%%%%
Step From Time

Remove yourself from the flow of time. Things around you will happen at their
usual busy pace, monsters will wander, perishable items will decay, plants will
grow. After some time has passed, you will return in the same state as the very
second you departed.
%%%%

Abort an ongoing skill transfer.
%%%%
# Vehumet
Memorise spell

Immediately gain knowledge of a destructive spell offered to you by Vehumet.
The offer will expire after a short while. Check the Religion screen (^) to see
which spell is offered.
%%%%
Renounce Religion

Renounce your faith. This will make your character leave your god (and usually
anger said god).
%%%%
Convert to Beogh

Swear your fealty to Beogh, the god of cave orcs. This god demands that all
non-believers must die, but new believers must be spared and accepted into the
fold. Beware, for orcs who haven't seen you convert may still be hostile until
you've built your reputation!

All other gods hate Beogh, and don't take desertion lightly.
