amulet of stasis

An amulet meticulously constructed with magical wards to block magical and

animal skin

A large piece of thick skin covered in fur, cut from the corpse of an animal
and worn as a primitive garment. It offers rudimentary protection against harm,
but, having never been tanned, it carries a light stench of rotting flesh.
%%%%
animal skin:quote

“He killed the noble Mudjokivis.
 Of the skin he made him mittens,
 Made them with the fur side inside,
 Made them with the skin side outside.
 He, to get the warm side inside,
 Put the inside skin side outside;
 He, to get the cold side outside,
 Put the warm side fur side inside.
 That's why he put the fur side inside,
 Why he put the skin side outside,
 Why he turned them inside outside.”

“MINERVA was the goddess of wisdom, but on one occasion she did a very foolish

the goddess threw a golden apple among the guests, with the inscription, ‘For

This is made two Ways, viz. either by infusing the Apricots cut in Pieces in

blowgun

A long, light tube, open at both ends, through which various types of needles
are propelled by puffs of breath at enemies. It makes very little noise.
%%%%
blowgun:quote

“Along the Upper Caiary-Uaupes blow-guns are made from the stems of a variety
of palm (Iriartea setigera Martius)... The Indian selects two stems of such
sizes that the smaller will exactly fit within the larger. After these stems
have been carefully dried and the pith cleared out with a long rod, the bore is
made smooth by drawing back and forth through it a little bunch of tree-fern
roots. The smaller stem is then inserted in the larger, so that one will serve
to correct any crookedness that may exist in the other. The wooden mouth-piece
is then fitted to one end, and about three and one half feet from it, a boar's
tooth is fastened on the gun by some gummy substance, for a sight. Over the
outside the maker winds spirally a strip of the dark shiny bark of a creeper
which gives it an ornamental finish, and his blow-gun is complete.
 ”The arrows are from ten to fourteen inches long, and of the thickness of an
ordinary lucifer match. Those of the Indians of the Caiary-Uaupes are made from
the midrib of a palm leaf or of the spinous processes of the Patawa (Enocarpus
Batawa) sharpened to a point at one end and wound near the other with a
delicate sort of wild cotton which grows in a pod upon a large tree (Bombax
ceiba). This mass of cotton is just big enough to fill the tube when the arrow
is gently pressed into it. The point is dipped into poison, allowed to dry, and
redipped until well coated. The exact composition of this poison is unknown,
and probably varies in different localities; but it would seem that the chief
ingredient is always the juice of a Strychnos plant. It is known among
different tribes by many names; such as Curari, Ourari, Urari and Woorali."
    -C.W. Mead, _The American Museum Journal_, vol. VIII. 1908.

%%%%
book of air

A primer on the elemental magics of Air. The pages often flip themselves, as if
blown by a stiff breeze; at other times, the pages are stuck together by static
electricity, and throw off brief sparks as they are separated.
%%%%
book of alchemy

A book focusing on alchemical processes and their use in magic spells,
collecting the wisdom of many ancient alchemists. When the book is opened, the
text is revealed as the ink condenses from the air onto the pages.
%%%%
book of annihilations

Blood leaks from the tattered pages of this book, and even an illiterate will
feel the sheer impact of arcane fury contained within. It is sought after by
sorcerers, for it allows the gifted and resourceful to command destruction with
ease. Feeble wizards, however, may well meet their doom when trying to read
this opus.
%%%%
book of beasts

A book of spells focused on the magical production of beasts, with pages made
from animal skins and covers lined with teeth. It reeks of a zoo, and will
occasionally nip at the fingers of careless readers.
%%%%
book of burglary

A book containing many diverse spells useful for theft, breaking and entering,
and other miscellaneous larceny. Sorcerers who let their attention lapse while
reading from this tome will occasionally turn a page to find that some small
item from their pockets has been pilfered and placed between the pages.
%%%%
book of callings

An introductory text on the magical Summoning of beasts and beings from other
realms. Tiny flies and gnats seem to pop up out of nowhere when the book is
opened, and then vanish when the book is closed.
%%%%
book of cantrips

A book containing a small selection of very basic magic spells, intended for
beginners who wish to learn the rudiments of one of the featured magical
schools. Nonetheless, even experienced mages can still find use for the spells
contained therein.
%%%%
book of changes

A student's primer to the magic arts of Transmutations, with many lavish
illustrations from the school's early experimental history:
half-wizard-half-Spiders, wizards with Blade Noses, or beaked tentacles instead
of legs. The text is full of reassurances that this kind of thing doesn't
happen anymore, though some potential Transmuters decide to take up Charms
instead.
%%%%
book of clouds

A book of magic spells for creating an assortment of clouds, sheathed in a fine
mist that sometimes makes the words appear a bit hazy. An insightful book,
though occasionally the author gets sidetracked into boring discussions about
what objects the cloud diagrams look like.
%%%%
book of conjurations

A book containing an introduction to the destructive magical arts of
Conjurations. It shudders with barely-contained power when it is opened.
%%%%
book of control

A book of magic spells for controlling minds, bodies, and even space. Wizards
who see the book lying around may feel a compulsion to browse through its
pages, and those who do sometimes find it hard to take their minds off the
sigils and runes inside.
%%%%
book of death

A ghoulishly illuminated manuscript containing dark spells of Necromancy,
written with inks distilled from corpses. Each page is filled with grotesque
art depicting scenes of disgusting decay and horrifying death, with much of the
text incorporated into the drawings as coils of entrails or arrangements of
bone.
%%%%
book of debilitation

A book containing Hexes useful for an Arcane Marksman. Many of the pages inside
are filled with holes, as if they had been used as archery targets before being
inscribed and bound. This occult technique supposedly gives the spells an
affinity for being used with ranged weapons, though, in practice, they appear
to work no differently from the variants found in less-perforated texts.
%%%%
book of dreams

A record of the somniloquent utterings of an entranced mystic, describing a
number of spells reflecting the mystic's dream state. Critics of the work argue
that the spells are functionally no different from ones already known, but the
book remains popular for its uniquely bizarre imagery and cryptic digressions.
%%%%
book of enchantments

A spellbook containing an assortment of magical Hexes and Charms, which
sparkles and shimmers as the pages are flipped. The quaintly anachronistic
title reflects an earlier, more incomplete arcane understanding of these two
schools of magic.
%%%%
book of envenomations

A book of magic spells, glowing with a sickly green light. This book was first
written by Olgreb, the infamous Venom Mage, who murdered many of his rivals by
sending them highly poisonous copies as gifts. Current editions are harmless,
though often dead bookworms and silverfish are found stuck between the pages.

%%%%
book of fire

A book, containing advanced spells in the elemental school of Fire. Many Fire
Elementalists have had their eyebrows and beards singed off by the momentary
flame that issues forth when the book is first opened, and some have even found
that, when left unattended for months, it can spontaneously combust,
occasionally burning down whole libraries in terrible conflagrations.
%%%%
book of flames

The standard text used in arcane academies by students of the elemental magic
of Fire. It is quite warm to the touch, and its edges are singed. The pages are
inscribed with sigils of flame that glow with flickering light to read by.
%%%%
book of frost

A book of magic spells, often used as an introduction to the elemental magics
of Ice. The cover is cold to the touch, and the mystic runes are written in a
flowing, jagged style, reminiscent of frost covering a window.
%%%%
book of geomancy

A book containing basic spells involving the element of Earth. It feels quite
dense, though no heavier than other spellbooks. When read, little bits of grit
spill from the pages, which appear to be made of thin sheets of mica.
%%%%
book of hinderance

A mystic manual dedicated to the art of slowing the minds and bodies of one's
foes, written in a cramped, nearly incomprehensible script on very rigid pages
that don't turn easily. Some wizards report a stiffness in their fingers while
they read, which goes away when the book is closed.
%%%%
book of ice

A book of advanced magical spells using the element of Ice. The book is
freezing cold, and the pages are covered in flaky bits of frost. Even though
they wear warm clothing, the scribes who write copies of this tome often suffer
frostbite or hypothermia.
%%%%
book of maledictions

This spellbook teaches Enchanters how to weaken and confound their enemies with
Hexes before finishing them off. The frontispiece contains a depiction of an
evil eye, an ancient cursed symbol; this has occasioned numerous tales of
adventurers who met bad ends after carrying this book into the dungeon. Though,
as sceptics point out, pretty much everybody who enters the dungeon meets a bad
end.
%%%%
book of minor magic

A spellbook containing a variety of simple but useful magical incantations.
Many prominent spellcasters used this book to begin their arcane studies. First
published three centuries ago, it is one of the most well-known grimoires in
the world, and is currently on its eighty-eighth printing.
%%%%
book of necromancy

A macabre book of magic spells, often the very first grimoire a beginning
Necromancer will learn from. Considering the hazards that can come with
dabbling in necromantic magic, this is also sometimes the very *last* grimoire
a beginning Necromancer will study.
%%%%
book of party tricks

This book contains a number of fun spells guaranteed to liven up any wizarding
party, as well as a number of toasts, jokes, and party games, all written in
bright colours and funny scripts. The spells in this book have been adjusted
slightly so they can be sung to the tunes of popular drinking songs.
%%%%
book of power

A book of powerful magic spells, coveted by ambitious wizards who seek to gain
ascendance over their rivals. It crackles and shudders with barely-contained
energies.
%%%%
book of spatial translocations

The classic text of the magical field of Translocations, written by the
archmage and accomplished Warper Golubria two centuries ago. This book can
still be found in magical libraries all across the world, although sometimes
not on the same shelf where the librarian left it.
%%%%
book of summonings

An advanced treatise on Summoning magics, detailing ways of summoning and
binding creatures from all manners of horrible realms. There are a number of
dire warnings with graphic illustrations of the dangers of summoning such
monsters, since not all of them will be friendly.
%%%%
book of the dragon

A magical book of spells which allow some command over dragons and their
aspects. The book is warm to the touch, bound in a scaly sort of leather, and
every page has a lavish illustration of a different variety of dragon, both
real and imaginary.
%%%%
book of the earth

A textbook for experienced Earth Elementalists. It has an aura of incredible
density, making those who look upon it feel as though they are standing under
hundreds of tons of rock, even when really under the open sky.
%%%%
book of the sky

A magical book containing powerful elemental spells of Air. The scribes who
produce copies of this grimoire are sequestered in high towers in the plains,
to better attune themselves to the forces of Air, and the coruscating runes are
written in flickering lightning.
%%%%
book of the tempests

This book contains magic spells which command some of the most destructive
forces of nature. When opened, lightning crackles between the pages, winds gust
against the reader's face, and the whole book shakes with violent tremors.
%%%%
book of the warp

A book of Translocations spells for experienced Warpers. Its shimmering pages
exist in multiple dimensions at once, not all of which obey the usual rules of
geometry. Some pages disappear when they're turned, while others appear out of
nowhere, and others pass directly through the other pages or themselves. Some
of the pages have three sides, or only one, or have fractional numbers of
corners. The effect can be disconcerting.
%%%%
book of transfigurations

An advanced book of Transmutations spells, written on constantly changing
material. At any given moment, a sorcerer could be reading words written on
paper, silk, stone, parchment, etched glass, wool, metal foil, snakeskin,
velvet, or a thousand other things.
%%%%
book of unlife

This unholy book describes a variety of magical methods for the creation and
command of undead servants. The dreadful book radiates a malignant aura, and
its parchment pages sometimes twitch and shudder on their own.
%%%%
book of war chants

A book of spells helpful for a warrior. The versions contained here have a
musical form, following the traditions of fighting skalds. Functionally,
though, they work the same as spells whose magic words are merely spoken.
%%%%
book of wizardry

A book of various magic spells, useful for any sufficiently-talented
spellcaster. Mages of a scholarly nature consider it a point of pride to have
contributed in some way to this work, though more than a few of them have been
slain by jealous rivals using their own spells against them.
%%%%
bottled efreet

A mighty efreet, captured by some wizard and bound into a bronze flask.
Breaking the flask's seal will release it to wreak havoc — possibly on you.

small matters as well as in those of greater importance, that he put his baker
in irons for serving him with one kind of bread and his guests with another...”

broad axe

A war axe improved with langets, spikes, a lengthed haft and a single-bladed
crescent head. It can inflict grievous wounds, but is cumbersome to manoeuvre
with just one hand due to its length and weight.

buckler

A small piece of wood and metal, to be strapped on one arm for defence. It is
somewhat cumbersome to wear, and, without a little training, slightly slows the
rate at which a warrior attacks.
%%%%
buckler:quote

“Let who will boast their courage in the field,
 I find but little safety from my shield.
 Nature's, not honour's, law we must obey:

 A life, which valour could not, from the grave.
 A better buckler I can soon regain;
 But who can get another life again?”

club

A heavy piece of wood, with a place to grip on one end and most of its weight

crystal ball of energy

A magical device which can be used to restore one's reserves of magical energy,

“She danced, and was compelled to dance—to dance in the dark night. The shoes
carried her on over thorn and brier; she scratched herself till she bled; she
danced away across the heath to a little lonely house. Here she knew the
executioner dwelt; and she tapped with her fingers on the panes, and
called,—'Come out, come out! I cannot come in, for I must dance!'
 And the Executioner said,—'You probably don’t know who I am? I cut off the bad
people’s heads with my axe, and mark how my axe rings!'
 'Do not strike off my head,' said Karen, 'for if you do I cannot repent of my
sin. But strike off my feet with the red shoes?'
 And then she confessed all her sin, and the Executioner cut off her feet with
the red shoes; but the shoes danced away with the little feet over the fields
and into the deep forest.
 And he cut her a pair of wooden feet, with crutches, and taught her a psalm,
which the criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand that had held the axe,
and went away across the heath.”

quarterstaff:quote

“Then Robin he unbuckled his belt,
 And laid down his bow so long;
 He took up a staff of another oak graff,
 That was both stiff and strong.
 'But let me measure,' said jolly Robin,
 'Before we begin our fray;
 For I'll not have mine to be longer than thine,
 For that will be counted foul play.'
 'I pass not for length,' bold Arthur replied,
 'My staff is of oak so free;
 Eight foot and a half it will knock down a calf,
 And I hope it will knock down thee.'
 Then Robin could no longer forbear,
 He gave him such a knock,
 Quickly and soon the blood came down,
 Before it was ten o'clock.
 About and about and about they went,
 Like two wild boars in a chase,
 Striving to aim each other to maim,
 Leg, arm, or any other place.
 And knock for knock they hastily dealt,
 Which held for two hours and more;
 That all the wood rang at every bang,
 They plied their work so sore.”
    -Anonymous, “Robin Hood and the Tanner”.
%%%%
quick blade

This carefully wrought short sword is preternaturally well-balanced, making it

rambutan:quote

“The rambutan (_nephelium lappaceum_) is a beautiful fruit to which I have
already alluded, as resembling the mammoth arbutus; and you suppose them at
first, when at a little distance from you, a delicious dish of some tropical
strawberry. But you find on inquiring into the ‘particulars within’ the outer
coat, that there is concealed beneath the red and hairy covering a
semi-transparent pulp of a pleasant acid taste, enveloping a single oval and
oblong seed. I know not but I am peculiar in my memory of the beautiful fruits
of the straits, but none lingers in my recollection so sweetly in its clustered
beauties of the fruit-dish as the bearded and rosy rambutan.”

Foreign Countries, in the United States Frigate Columbia_. 1847.

scroll of vorpalise weapon

This scroll enchants the wielded weapon so as to make it far more effective at
inflicting harm on its wielder's enemies. Using it on a weapon already affected
by some kind of permanent branding is not advised. On the other hand, the
scroll can make permanent the temporary branding of weapons obtained from some
spells.

the Shining One) cannot be affixed this way. Xom, on the other hand, wouldn't
let such an opportunity for fun go to waste.

This scroll cancels all magical enchantments from the reader and from beings in
the vicinity. Also, the magical resistances of the reader and nearby beings are
halved for a short duration. The latter effect does not apply to beings fully
immune to magic.
%%%%
scroll of silence

This scroll eliminates all sound near the reader. This makes reading scrolls,
casting spells, praying or yelling in the reader's vicinity impossible. (It
applies to the reader, too, of course.)

This silence will not hide your presence, since its oppressive, unnatural
effect will almost certainly alert any living creature that something is very
wrong. Silence starts out with a radius covering half the normal vision range,
which will then shrink, eventually covering only the reader, before the effect
times out.

Note that demons do not need sound to cast spells; certain necromantic fixtures
have this property as well.

throwing net

A mesh of ropes knotted together with weights around the edge. Originally used
by hunters to entangle and entrap prey, it soon found obvious application in
battle and gladiatorial arenas. Struggling victims can eventually destroy the
net and break free, if they live long enough.

trident:quote

“Without noticing the occupations of an intervening day or two, which, as they
consisted of the ordinary sylvan amusements of shooting and coursing, have
nothing sufficiently interesting to detain the reader, we pass to one in some
degree peculiar to Scotland, which may be called a sort of salmon-hunting. This
chase, in which the fish is pursued and struck with barbed spears, or a sort of
long shafted trident, called a waster, is much practised at the mouth of the
Esk, and in the other salmon rivers of Scotland.”
    -Sir Walter Scott, _Guy Mannering_, ch. XXVI. 1815.
%%%%
triple sword

A magical weapon with three great razor-sharp blades. According to legend, a
master forger created a sword with two blades at the facetious suggestion of a
knight, who, finding that the resulting blade was quite functional, jovially
quipped, "Ah, very good, but could you make a *triple* sword?" When the answer
turned out to be yes, the knight was too shocked to ask about the possibilities
of a quadruple sword.

%%%%
troll hide:quote

“THE TROLL KING: Now, listen, Prince Peer, and give way to reason!
 You're cut out for a Troll. Why, look, already
 You bear yourself quite in a Troll-like fashion!
 And you want to become one, don't you?
 PEER GYNT: Of course.
 In return for a bride and a well-found kingdom
 I'm not unwilling to sacrifice something;
 But all things have their natural limit.
 I have taken a tail, it is true; but, then,
 I can undo the knots that our friend has tied
 And take the thing off. I have shed my breeches;
 They were old and patched; but that won't prevent me
 From putting them on if I have a mind to.
 I shall probably find it just as easy
 To deal with your Trollish way of living.
 I can easily swear that a cow's a maiden;
 An oath's not a difficult thing to swallow.
 But to know that one never can get one's freedom —
 Not even to die as a human being —
 To end one's days as a Troll of the mountains —
 Never go back, as you tell me plainly —
 That is a thing that I'll not submit to.”
    -Henrik Ibsen, _Peer Gynt_ . 1867.
