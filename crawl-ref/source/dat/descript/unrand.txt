%%%%
Mace of Variability

It is rather unreliable.
%%%%
Glaive of Prune

It is the creation of a mad god, and carries a curse which
transforms anyone possessing it into a prune. Fortunately, the
curse works very slowly, and one can use it briefly with no
consequences worse than slightly purple skin and a few wrinkles.
%%%%
Sword of Power

It rewards the powerful with power and the meek with weakness.
%%%%
Staff of Olgreb

It was the magical weapon wielded by the mighty wizard Olgreb
before he met his fate somewhere within these dungeons. It

some limited effect even on creatures immune to all commonly known
poisons.

#demon blade "Bloodbane"
%%%%
#scimitar of Flaming Death
%%%%

This knife was made by Spriggans, or for Spriggans, or possibly

in his part of the world. Yet his reign didn't last long, stopped by a
single puny human who then made this armour from the dragon's hide.
%%%%
hat of the Alchemist

A dirty hat. It bears signs of surviving many weird explosions, which
suggests it may have means of protecting the head inside from the risks
involved with alchemy experiments. And with the kind of protections granted
by this hat, it's certain some prior head damage was a prerequisite for even
thinking about such experiments.
%%%%
fencer's gloves

A pair of gloves made of white silk.
%%%%
cloak of Starlight

A phosphorescent cloak, woven of pure light beams.
%%%%
ratskin cloak

from rats of all kinds.
%%%%

you probably don't care.

Pandemonium so that unsuspecting adventurers like you would
unleash demons into this world. Beware, for this axe has
ways of taking its wielder under its command...

body. Faintly crackling with electricity, they have been enchanted
to allow their wearer to slither at almost a human's pace.
%%%%
Black Knight's horse barding

This gear used to be worn by the personal horse of the Black Knight
during his reign of terror. Pitch-black, it appears to be made not
only of some strange black steel, but also of entire plates of
black diamond! Naturally, such a weight of metal and stone cannot
be good for the mount's speed. However, it offers not only mundane
protection against blows; the adamant bears an enchantment that
makes its wearer partially undead.
