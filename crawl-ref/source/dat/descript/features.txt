%%%%
A Zot trap

This trap bears a powerful enchantment that inflicts dangerously unpredictable
magical effects on those unlucky enough to trigger it. It's often worse than
mere damage — you may find yourself thrown into the Abyss, contaminated with
enormous amounts of wild magic, have mighty fiends summoned against you, or the
like — it is something to avoid at all costs.
%%%%
A basalt altar of Yredelemnul

'어둠의  이레델렘눌'의 제단이다. 현무암 재질의 기둥들로 만들어져 있다.

You can see the edge of a massive scythe-like blade hidden in a slit; it

An altar to Trog the Wrathful, crudely made by what seem to be the hands of
giants and covered with bloodstains.
%%%%
A blossoming altar of Fedhas

%%%%
A bolt trap

A well-concealed hole containing a crossbow-like contraption with a
self-loading mechanism. Beware of its bolts, as a steel construction can reach
draw forces far above those of a living arbalester.
%%%%
A broken pillar

The makers of this pillar were overrun long ago. No one alive remembers why
they built it.
%%%%
A burning altar of Makhleb

An ever-burning altar to Makhleb the Destroyer. Strange, twisting shapes are
visible in the flames.
%%%%
A dart trap

This trap can shoot relatively weak spikes of metal. They are unlikely to kill
anyone outright, but may be enough to put down someone who's running half-dead
while chased by some monster.
%%%%
A detected secret door

A wooden door, cunningly hidden. It used to be a secret door but at least for
you it's not a secret anymore.

To open it, try simply walking into it, or press 'O'.
%%%%
A closed door

나무 문이다. 문을 열려면 'O'키를 누르거나, 간단하게 문으로 이동하면 된다.
%%%%

%%%%
A one-way gate leading to the halls of Pandemonium

This gate leads to the endless halls of Pandemonium. Tales about successful
lootings of these netherworlds are rare. Even the strongest and most
experienced characters can die there. On the other hand, these halls contain
several runes and lots of valuable items. It is much easier to get in than to
get out.
%%%%
A gas trap

You're lucky to have noticed this trap, for it would have released a cloud of
deadly gas at you. Exactly what gas it holds, you cannot tell — perhaps it is
plain poison, perhaps mutagenic fumes, perhaps flammable vapour, or perhaps
something yet nastier.
%%%%
A gate to the Realm of Zot

This gate leads to the Realm of Zot, the final stage of your quest as its
deepest level houses the infamous Orb of Zot. Both the Orb and this Realm have
a fearsome and questionable reputation, but one piece of information seems to
be certain: The monsters inhabiting this area and protecting the Orb are strong
and strange — some of them encountered nowhere but here.
%%%%
A gateway back into the Dungeon

This gate allows a feat popularly thought to be impossible: escaping Hell
alive.
%%%%
A gateway leading out of the Abyss

A gateway out of this accursed place, shimmering and shifting in the
impermanent landscape.
%%%%
A gateway to a ziggurat

This portal leads to an ancient ziggurat, a place of untold challenges and
untold riches.

The portal is usable just once, and there's a large monetary fee to be paid.
%%%%
A gateway to the ashen valley of Gehenna

You can feel the heat. Gehenna seems to be made out of nothing but flames, lava
and hellfire.
%%%%
A gateway to Hell

%%%%

its radiance.
%%%%
A glowing silver altar of Zin

are expected to be, and glowing gently.
%%%%
A granite statue

Despite the hardness of the stone, this statue's features have long withered
away.
%%%%
A hole to the Spider Nest

This is more of a natural sloped shaft than a stairway, but it will do. If you
want to die from most potent venoms of this world, that is.
%%%%
A labyrinth entrance

A gateway to an intricate maze designed by subtle and malicious minds, its exit
guarded by a fearsome monster. Many a hapless adventurer has lost his way in
the twisted, shifting passages, and starved to death.
%%%%
A mangrove

This tree is specially adapted for growing in swampy conditions. Its vines are
too thick to see through.
%%%%
A magical trap

침입자들을 격퇴하기 위해 만들어진 마법 장치로, 이것은 해제가 불가능하다.
%%%%
A mechanical trap

A mechanical contraption designed to harm trespassers. A skilled adventurer can

A natural trap

자연적으로 만들어진 위험물이다. 완전히 침입자들을 격퇴하기 위해 일부러 만들었다고 해도 믿을 정도로..

will ground.
%%%%
A needle trap

It is damn sure the needles from this trap are doused in something nasty.
%%%%
A net trap

A large concealed net is hanging from the dungeon's ceiling, with a string
attached and rigged to make it fall onto anyone who trips it.
%%%%
A one-way gate to the infinite horrors of the Abyss

A one-way gate to a demon-haunted realm, riven by chaos, its very substance
impermanent and whimsical, filled with creatures out of nightmare. Easy to
enter, difficult to leave.
%%%%
A passage of Golubria

This unstable gateway allows instantaneous travel to another nearby passage of
Golubria, and will close behind anything passing through it.
%%%%
A portal to somewhere

A gash-like tear in reality that looks into some terrifying, starry otherworld.
Thankfully, the magic that opened this portal prevents its vacuum from
consuming and swallowing everything in sight.
%%%%
A pressure plate

One of the floor stones doesn't seem that sturdy, and you notice that it is a
trigger of some sort, although you can't tell what kind of trap it is attached
to.
%%%%
A radiant altar of Vehumet

An altar, ablaze in the lights of Iskenderun and promising great destructive
powers to those who would follow Vehumet.
%%%%
A rock wall

평범한 바위로 이루어져 있는 벽이다.
%%%%
A rock-blocked tunnel

The way you came in doesn't seem to be passable anymore.

A shaft

%%%%
A shattered altar of Ashenzari

This crystal altar shattered to pieces when Ashenzari was cursed. But still,
there is power here: a dark aura holds the shards in mid-explosion, suspended
in time and space much like the god they herald.
%%%%
A shimmering altar of Xom

This altar constantly shimmers in all visible colours and probably some
invisible ones, too, matching the whims of Xom the Unpredictable, to whom it is
dedicated.
%%%%
A shop

A shop in the dungeon, beyond sight of the world above, manned by a secretive
and reclusive shopkeeper who cannot be bargained with, grants no refunds, and
is interested in nothing you may have to sell. Some shops hawk antiques of
unknown provenance, and offer little hint as to the quality or nature of their
goods.
%%%%
A slime covered rock wall

이 암벽은, 슬라임질의 산성 점액으로 두껍게 덮여 있다. 으으.

kind of stuff. Also taxes and whatever else you ran from.

Climbing these stairs will end your quest, whether you carry the Orb with you
or not.
%%%%
A staircase to the Crypt

These stairs lead to an ancient crypt. Unfortunately, not everything that was
buried there had the decency to stay dead.
%%%%
A staircase to the Ecumenical Temple

An entrance to a temple of Gods, a place of peace and refuge from the insanity
of the dungeon.
%%%%
A staircase to the Elven Halls

A wide stair down to the murky depths of the halls of the deep elves, skilled
warriors with blades and bows, and fearsome sorcerers and magicians.
%%%%

%%%%
A staircase to the Orcish Mines

%%%%
A staircase to the Dwarven Hall

An entrance to the well-worked hall of the dwarves. You think you can smell
ale.

A staircase to the Enchanted Forest

An entrance to the spriggan forest. Snap a twig and you're dead. Actually, they

%%%%
A staircase to the Shoals

A harder obstacle than rock walls. Only the mightiest magic can shatter stone
walls.
%%%%
A teleporter

Stepping on this teleporter will send you to another room.
%%%%
A teleportation trap

This magical trap can displace anyone hapless enough to step on it — or even
fly above it — to a random place on the same dungeon level.
%%%%
A translucent rock wall

The mineral this rock consists of is as translucent as good quality glass.
Whether it is natural or magical, you can't tell.
%%%%
A translucent stone wall

A harder obstacle than rock walls. Only the mightiest magic can shatter stone
walls. It has been imbued with arcane magics which render it translucent.
%%%%
A translucent unnaturally hard rock wall

This wall is imbued with magic that not only makes it indestructible but also
makes it translucent like glass.
%%%%
A tree

While the dungeon is filled with dim magic light, in most places it is not
bright enough to sustain any larger plants. It is uneven, though, and there are
spots where, with the grace of Fedhas, trees as big as those on the surface can
grow underground.
%%%%
A viscous altar of Jiyva

A slimy, ever-shifting altar to Jiyva. You're not sure what it's made from, and
you don't really want to know.
%%%%
A wall of green crystal

For some reason, some dungeon walls, like this one, have been made of this
polished crystal, imbued with arcane magics. They prevent its easy destruction,
and make it reflect heat and cold.
%%%%
A wall of the weird stuff which makes up Pandemonium

This wall is made from the weird stuff which makes up Pandemonium, but seems to
be like rock in most other aspects.
%%%%
A white marble altar of Elyvilon

An altar to Elyvilon the Healer, made from purest white marble and topped by a
sculpture of the Chalice of Purification.
%%%%
A web

The spider who left this web must have been huge, as it seems to be made for
trapping {{ return you.genus(true) }} rather than flies.
%%%%
An abandoned shop

문 닫은 상점이다.
%%%%
An alarm trap

While this trap does no damage by itself, its loud sound may bring someone to
do damage to you. Of course, you have the option to do damage to those someones
yourself.
%%%%
An ancient bone altar of Kikubaaqudgha

Ancient bones were piled here to form an altar to the terrible Demon-God
Kikubaaqudgha.
%%%%
An arrow trap

You can see several bowstrings and arrows attached to fixed bow-like things.
Typically, in a trap like this, only one is released every time the trigger is
tripped. Such a trap is cheaper and easier to make than an auto-loading
mechanism and a steel bow with the monstrous draw force of a bolt trap, so
don't expect enormous damage. Still, a mere arrow through the artery is enough
to kill a person.
%%%%
An empty arch of ancient stone

A stone archway that seems to have stood here forever and doesn't seem to lead
anywhere in particular.
%%%%
An escape hatch in the ceiling

용수철을 이용한 원리로 만들어진, 천장에 붙어 있는 일방 통행 탈출구다.

If you ever wanted to escape out of the pan into the fire, this is your chance.
This gateway allows you to return from this place via a nice scenic path

An iron altar of Okawaru

An altar of iron and steel dedicated to the Warmaster Okawaru. Its edges are

An iron grate

This iron grate looks rusted, as if it could be disrupted with a spell or a

An open door

A wooden door. You can close it by standing next to it and {{

%%%%
An unnaturally hard rock wall

어째서인지, 흠집조차 나지 않는 암벽이다.
%%%%
The endless lava

A sea of fire and brimstone that goes as far as you can see. Which is not far
because of thick smoke.

Unlike small pools of lava where flight or levitation may allow short trips,
floating above this inferno would cook you in no time thanks to runaway
convection.
%%%%
A floor

A well-worn stone floor made of closely fitted granite flagstones that were
hewn and set untold ages ago by long-forgotten hands.
%%%%
Some deep water

This water is as deep as it is dangerous. No sane traveller would attempt to
set foot into it, apart from those able to fly or swim. Be warned: many
confused adventurers have met their death in the depths, and an unexpected end
of levitation has drowned even more careless interlopers.
%%%%
Some lava

용해되어있는 암석들로 이루어진, 극히 뜨거운 용암이다. 흡사 지옥 같은 연기를 내뿜고 있다.
%%%%
Some shallow water

This cloudy, waist-deep water makes movement and combat cumbersome for
landlubbers — this is sometimes dangerous, but never directly fatal.
%%%%
The open sea

Nothing but endless wind and waves, and not a lighthouse in sight. You'd be
lost beyond all hope in short order — better not risk it.

# wizlab: Wucad Mu
An autumnal tree

These trees, large as they are, appear to be permanently locked in an autumnal
moment: leaves, coloured red and gold, fall from branches and float gracefully
to the floor. Before they even reach the ground, however, a shadow passes, and
when the shimmer is gone, the leaves are once more on the branch, ready to fall
again.
%%%%
A crumbled stone wall

These walls, though they have fallen into disrepair, appear as locked in time
as the trees, ready to collapse, but utterly unable to.
%%%%
A strange statue

The features of this statue are strange and alien. Is it because the statue is
worn and tarnished that it has become so unrecognisable? Or is it that the

# wizlab: Cloud Mage
A damp floor

Perhaps it is the humidity, or the constant flow of clouds, but the floor here
remains forever damp.
%%%%
A wall of white crystal

This is lower-grade crystal. It is hardly translucent at all, and its crooked
faces make things worse. The opalescent gleam still looks pretty nice, though.
%%%%
A wall of transparent white crystal

This crystal seems flawless and imperishable. It might be diamond or something
of this kind — whatever it is, it is beyond your means of breaching it.

# Ice Cave
An ice choked empty arch of ancient stone

It looks like the way you came in has been unused for ages. The portal is not
only old and inoperative, but also nearly completely encased in a mass of ice.

Fortunately, you can see another portal shimmering nearby.
%%%%
An ice covered gate leading back out of here

A still-working portal is standing here. Its magic is holding the ice at bay,
preventing it from completely blocking the gate. You are quite certain that you
won't be able to return here after you pass through it, though, so you'd better
explore this place first.

Or, perhaps, escape with your life before you freeze into an ugly-looking
icicle.
%%%%
An ice covered rock wall

The rock here is covered by a thick layer of frost and ice. Since you can see
liquid water dripping in places, it is obvious how this cave came to be: water
seeped into cracks in the rock and then froze, slowly delving the place you're
in. And so it delves on your remaining body heat.
%%%%
Some ice crusted deep water

The ice here is broken into pieces, and the water it floats on doesn't look
inviting in the slightest.

Some ice crusted shallow water

It looks freezing, but if you don't mind hypothermia, you can probably wade
through it.
