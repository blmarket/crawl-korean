Aizul

Once the primary guardian serpent of a legendary treasure hoard, he was
disgraced after thieves looted it while he slept. He now slithers about the
dungeon, seeking vengeance against all would-be looters. He is an accomplished
spellcaster, but no more deadly in melee combat than others of his kind.

Agnes

This somewhat older looking spriggan carries a bladed staff (almost as large as

coins and lajatang do not seem to slow her, though, as she darts to and fro,
her pockets streaming behind her and trembling as if about to burst.
%%%%
Antaeus

Once a mighty and renowned titan, his arrogance was his undoing. Now he is
corrupt and tainted, a powerful demon who lords over the frozen wastes of
Cocytus. His gigantic body seems as though it would be easily struck by your

all but the strongest of them.
%%%%
Antaeus:quote

“That country was then ruled by Antaeus, son of Poseidon, who used to kill

a son of Earth.”

Arachne

Once the best human weaver, Arachne was cursed by being transformed into her
present form: half-human, half-spider. No longer aging, she has the youth and
beauty of a human female, along with the legs and abdomen of a monstrous giant
spider.

Thousands of years old, she has learned magic and quite a few other tricks.
Expect to be ensnared by webs and magic while her pets digest and then drink

“For myself, I have other occupations:  I make absurd matches; I marry
greybeards with minors, masters with servants, girls with small fortunes with

Fannar

A cold-hearted elven sorcerer, draped in robes of high office. He whispers
grimly to himself as he stalks the dungeon, trailing ice crystals through the
air behind him.

In ages long past, Fannar's wisdom and precocious talent with frost magic won
him the coveted position of magistrate, placing him in charge of enforcing the
law throughout the Elven Halls. By all accounts, he was once well known for
being benevolent, just, and passionate in keeping the elves free from
corruption and crime, even as those around him began to dabble in necromancy
and demonic magic.

Over the long centuries of his tenure, Fannar's devotion to justice has warped
into paranoia and despotism. Even his closest supporters now whisper that his
magical power has begun to border on the self-destructive. Fannar still tries
to keep the elves from falling to evil, unwilling or unable to notice that he
failed long ago.

the Lernaean hydra:quote

“The second Labour which he undertook was the slaying of the Lernaian Hydra,
 springing from whose single body were fashioned a hundred necks, each bearing
 the head of a serpent. And when one head was cut off, the place where it was
 severed put forth two others; for this reason it was considered to be
 invincible, and with good reason, since the part of it which was subdued sent
 forth a two-fold assistance in its place. Against a thing so difficult to
 manage as this Herakles devised an ingenious scheme and commanded Iolaos to
 sear with a burning brand the part which had been severed, in order to check
 the flow of the blood.”

Louise had become powerful indeed, but had also gone fully insane. She now

“This night the Lord of Illusion passed among you, Mara, mighty among dreamers,

“'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman leaves

school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away
they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming,

astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the

 With poison, instead of blood, she filled their bodies.
 Fierce monster-vipers she clothed with terror,
 With splendor she decked them, she made them of lofty stature.

 Out there jumped a little devil, blue in colour; and before
 I could speak to the new comer (for I never was struck dumber),
 Down upon my empty rummer, straight the little devil bore,
 Right into my empty tumbler straight the little devil bore,
 Squatted, grinned and nothing more.

 There the little imp sat grinning at me while my head went spinning,
 So that had I not sat down I should have fallen upon the floor;
 'Though thy looks be somewhat evil,' said I ”tell me thou blue devil,
 Wherefore holdest though thy revel in the glass that held before
 Much the more agreeable spirit,—mizzle! leave me as before.“
 Then the imp said 'Never-more!'

 Though I felt uncommon funky, still this answer put my monkey
 Up, and at the small blue devil in an undertone I swore.
 Then I said I must be dreaming, although broad awake I'm seeming;
 Doubtless I shall have a screaming morning headache — what a bore:
 Salmon I will eat no more.”

into the house of a quiet, inoffensive, and laborious farmer; and, when once it
had taken possession it disputed the right of domicile with the legal mortal
tenant, in a very unneighbourly and arbitrary manner. In particular, it seemed
to have a great aversion to children. As there is no point on which a parent
feels more acutely than that of the maltreatment of his offspring, the feelings
of the father and more particularly of his good dame, were daily, ay, and
nightly, harrowed up by the malice of this malignant and invisible boggart.”

catoblepas:quote

“So passed he over into the island, taking with him the two brothers of
Anaxius; where he found the forsaken knight attired in his own livery, as black
as sorrow itself could see itself in the blackest glass: his ornaments of the
same hue, but formd into the figures of ravens which seemed to gape for
carrion: only his reins were snakes, which finely wrapping themselves one
within the other, their heads came together to the cheeks and bosses of the
bit, where they might seem to bite at the horse, and the horse, as he champed
the bit, to bite at them, and that the white foam was engendered by the
poisonous fury of the combat. His impresa was a Catoblepta, which so long lies
dead as the moon (whereto it hath so natural a sympathy) wants her light. The
word signified, that the moon wanted not the light, but the poor beast wanted
the moon’s light.”

clay golem:quote

“Once upon a time a great Cabbalist lived in Prague called the Rabbi Löw. He
made a human figure of clay, and left a small aperture in the lesser brain in
which he laid a parchment with the unutterable name of God written on it. The
clod immediately arose and was a man; he performed all the duties of a servant
for his creator, he fetched water, and hewed wood. All through the Jews quarter
he was known as the Golem of the great Rabbi Löw. Every Friday evening the
Rabbi took the parchment out of his head, and he was clay until Sunday morning.
Once the Rabbi forgot this duty, all were in the Synagogue, the Sabbath hymn
was begun, when all the women and children in the assembly started and screamed
out, ‘the Golem! the Golem is destroying everything!’ The Rabbi ordered the
precentor to pause at the end of the prayer: it was yet possible to save all,
but later nought would avail, the whole world would be destroyed. He hastened
home, and saw the Golem already seizing the joists of his house to tear down
the building: he sprang forward, took the parchment out, and dead clay again
lay at his feet.”

“When Hesperus, the Evening Star, has shown his lovely face
 Three times, from that day, and the defeated stars fled Phoebus,
 It will be the ancient sacred rites of the Lemuria,
 When we make offerings to the voiceless spirits.
 ...
 When midnight comes, lending silence to sleep,
 And all the dogs and hedgerow birds are quiet,
 He who remembers ancient rites, and fears the gods,
 Rises (no fetters binding his two feet)
 And makes the sign with thumb and closed fingers,
 Lest an insubstantial shade meets him in the silence.
 After cleansing his hands in spring water,
 He turns and first taking some black beans,
 Throws them with averted face: saying, while throwing:
 'With these beans I throw I redeem me and mine.'
 He says this nine times without looking back: the shade
 Is thought to gather the beans, and follow behind, unseen.
 Again he touches water, and sounds the Temesan bronze,

golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle.
They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be
credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird,
all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the
body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as
he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent
inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball
is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt,
plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such

“Telimena, wearied with the prolonged wrangling, wanted to go out into the
fresh air, but sought a partner. She took a little basket from the peg.
“Gentlemen, I see that you wish to remain within doors,” she said, wrapping
around her head a red cashmere shawl, “but I am going for mushrooms: follow me
who will!” Under one arm she took the little daughter of the Chamberlain, with
the other she raised her skirt up to her ankles. Thaddeus silently hastened
after her—to seek mushrooms!”

ynoxinul:quote

“He fixed his eyes upon the door, which, slowly opening, disclosed a stranger

summoned? 'I did not summon you,' said the trembling student. 'You did!' said
the stranger, advancing, angrily; 'and the demons are not to be invoked in
vain.' The student could make no reply; and the demon, enraged that one of the
uninitiated should have summoned him out of mere presumption, seized him by the
throat and strangled him.

When Agrippa returned, a few days afterwards, he found his house beset with
devils. Some of them were sitting on the chimneypots, kicking up their legs in
the air; while others were playing at leapfrog, on the very edge of the
parapet. His study was so filled with them that he found it difficult to make
his way to his desk.”

A corpse raised to undeath by necromancy.
%%%%
zombie:quote

“It seemed that while the zombie came from the grave, it was neither a ghost,
nor yet a person who had been raised like Lazarus from the dead. The zombie,
they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and
endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life—it is a dead body which
is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive. People who have the power
to do this go to a fresh grave, dig up the body before it has had time to rot,
galvanize it into movement, and then make of it a servant or slave,
occasionally for the commission of some crime, more often simply as a drudge
around the habitation or the farm, setting it dull heavy tasks, and beating it
like a dumb beast if it slackens.”
    -William Seabrook, _The Magic Island_. 1929.

test spawner

(If you see this outside wizmode or the arena, this is a bug.)

Whatever it is, it is capable of spawning countless monsters by casting Shadow
Creatures, and is virtually undestructible itself.

To destroy it, lower the central elevator pillar, then pump rockets into the
hole in its exposed brain when the pillar rises to an appropriate height. You
can add another rocket while jumping down.

Oh wait, wrong game.

# arena sprint final boss
Master Blaster

A mighty old lich, notorious for blasting people with powerful conjurations at
the slightest provocation, or just on a whim.
%%%%
Statue of Wucad Mu

This statue, made of a fine glassy orange crystal, depicts a mystic known as
Wucad Mu, who mastered the matters of the mind. Beware of the statue's powers,
as you have no chance in mental combat against it.

This statue is very brittle; it will disintegrate at once.
%%%%
air elementalist statue

A delicate statue of a tengu gliding through the air. It looks quite
insubstantial.
%%%%

An unfathomably ancient skeleton. It has hundreds of golden sigils etched onto
its bones, and pulses with terrible, unholy power.
%%%%

This tree bears fruit that can feed a hungry tiger. And that's not an error —
you will serve as the middle step in the food chain.
%%%%
apricot tree

<apple tree>
%%%%
archer statue

The likeness of a beautiful elven archer, sculpted in finest marble. It holds a
bow aloft, and appears to be magically animated, letting it use the bow to
riddle you with arrows.

Being a statue, it doesn't appear to have a means of salvaging shot arrows or
fletching new ones, but you guess the statue's creators gave it enough of a
supply to kill you before someone comes to replenish the quiver.
%%%%
bittermelon vine

An ordinary looking plant, growing some barely edible fruits. They provide
nutrition, but certainly not good taste.
%%%%
black sheep

On first glance, this sheep has merely a different pigmentation, but you are
not so easily swayed by looks. With your luck, there's a sheep in a wolf's hide
hiding inside, _then_ covered by another layer of sheep skin to better deceive
you.

Or, maybe, it's just a sheep after all.
%%%%
centaur hunter

This particularly battle-adept centaur is an extremely precise shot with its
longbow.
%%%%
charred statue

It looks like this statue has been imbued with fire magic, letting it use
fire-based conjurations against you. Fortunately, it looks pretty ineptly made,
and its charring shows that it has trouble controlling its magic as well.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Monster

This terrifying creation looks to have been constructed from the body parts of
every monstrous creature imaginable.
%%%%
Cigotuvi's Monster:quote

“I beheld the wretch — the miserable monster whom I had

This grotesque statue, carved from brilliant blue ice, gives a fell chill to
its surroundings. It's as though it's actively absorbing the heat from its

conjurer statue

This statue seems to harness the mightiest pure conjurations ever devised by
Iskenderun. It is not made in her likeness, as legends describe her as a female
felid, but, if I were you, I'd pay more heed to the orbs of magic flying your
way than the statue's appearance.
%%%%
crystal guardian

This crystal golem is so ensorcelled that it is immune to nearly any magic
itself, and it can also shoot powerful beams of fire and cold at any
tresspassers.

It seems a flimsy representation of a monk; nothing more than a half-formed
memory.
%%%%
deformed humanoid

This poor creature looks hideously deformed.
%%%%
demonic plant

Just as demons are shaped in a mockery of living beings, this... thing... here
is a mockery of a plant. The colours don't match, and normal plants don't have
mysterious appendages and tentacles writhing around. Fortunately, this one
appears to be harmless, but with demons, you can never be sure.
%%%%

This short fellow seems to be working as an ale quality tester, and is enjoying
the job a little too much.
%%%%

The air shimmers around this demonic-looking humanoid, as though it radiates
intense heat. Wisps of smoke trail from its fingertips.
%%%%
demonspawn sorcerer

The air crackles around this demonic-looking humanoid; it clearly wields magic
of some power.
%%%%
draconian transmuter

A draconian who has eschewed the study of weaponry, training in the art of
transmutations. While its scaly fists, well-thewed leg, and mighty tail are
lethal on their own, its combat prowess can be increased even further by the
spells it wields.

An ineptly made statue of a mage. Its magic keeps leaking, letting you know
what kind of spells you can expect: cold-based ones.
%%%%
glowing angel

A divine agent of Zin, it is a towering winged figure with an aura of brilliant
white light. This angel's face, though, is marked by a scowl, as if its zeal
against any real or perceived vice overshadows its goodness.
%%%%
gourd plant

This sturdy vine bears nutritious but nearly tasteless fruits.
%%%%
grape vine

Without a gardener to provide it with something to prop itself over, and not
being lucky enough to have its seed fall near something it can climb, this
grape vine is still remarkably hard to step over.
%%%%

%%%%
grey elf

Once considered a unique species of its own, grey elves are now more properly
classified as a sub-species of high elf. Little exists to distinguish them from
their high elf cousins, aside from their supposed glamour (which is probably
more myth than fact).
%%%%
high elf sorcerer

This apparently adventurous high elf is just as proficient in magic as its deep
elven brethren.
%%%%
hill dwarf

Hill dwarves are a subrace of dwarves who, as their name implies, live on
hills. Once able adventurers, the hill dwarves no longer have any interest in
dungeon delving. This one was captured specially for this exhibit.

While most halfling adventurers prefer stealth to direct combat, here stands

%%%%
minotaur monk

A particularly adventurous and agile minotaur, capable of tearing apart the
unwary with naught but its bare hands.
%%%%
mountain dwarf

Mountain dwarves are surface-dwelling relatives of the deep dwarves. After
years of war with the taller but otherwise quite similar hill orcs, the
mountain dwarves were conquered and driven from these lands. This one has been
imported from foreign shores.

An ancient magician, embalmed and cursed to walk in undeath for all eternity.
Even in undeath, it retains many of its powers of magic.

musa plant

This bushy plant can grow bananas. Or are they banananas? Or bananananas? Some
yellow curved thingies, at least.

mighty rage at the slightest hint of food.

A massive floating ball. It resembles ball lightning, but looks far more
stable. It definitely lacks some heavy-duty insulation, though.
%%%%
# I'm not sure how widely cosmogonical Norse myths are known to an average
# reader; Crawl's audience tends to be far more educated though, so let's

orb of ice

A globe of primordial ice, floating in the air. You don't know whether the
tales about the world's once being a void bracketed by realms of endless fire
and cold are true, but if they are, this orb may be a relic of that ancient
time.

Ordinary ice seems to form on the surface, but it is easy to distinguish from
the perfect ball inside. You'd better stay far away, or you may end up frozen.
%%%%
orb slug

A monstrously big slug who apparently ate a mighty conjurer, or maybe an orb
spider. Or perhaps it's a product of divine experiments, in which case it looks
like Xom's handiwork...
%%%%
orc berserker

A tough, strong, and particularly angry orc.

Something has turned these ordinary plants into stone. Better not tarry here.
If whatever petrified these plants gets you as well, we'll be stuck with a

An otherworldly spider that can move short and medium distances by briefly
shifting between the planes of reality, in order to better ensnare its prey.
%%%%
pristine statue

An immaculately sculpted porphyry statue of an archer poised to release an
arrow, with a full quiver at the hip. The individually sculpted arrows look
almost as if they could be removed one by one and used in a real bow.

pyrus tree

<apple tree>

%%%%
sludge elf earth mage

A sludge elf particularly well-attuned to the powers of earth.
%%%%
skeletal archer

Since when is having flesh a requirement to be a master archer? These skeletal
fellows can turn you into a bloody hedgehog with ease. Meatlings like you are
only good for a supply of sinew for bowstrings anyway.

%%%%
spriggan necromancer

Raising the dead, and then running behind them... these tricks start getting

%%%%
spriggan shepherd

Being unable to digest meat, spriggans here need quite a lot of milk to

you some respect.
%%%%

strawberry plant

The same radiation that made cockroaches and spiders the size of small dogs
didn't spare this humble strawberry plant, either. Fortunately, even with its
size, it appears to be harmless.
%%%%
succubus

A female demon who uses her charms to seduce humanoid males. If you wish to
take advantage of her, however, you will fail: she seems very angry right now
and has blood more on her mind than fun.
%%%%
tengu aerator

This particularly ferocious tengu is well on its way towards mastery of air
magic.
%%%%
tengu conjurer

One of many tengu with a talent for the destructive magical arts.
%%%%
water elementalist statue

A smooth, charming statue of a beautiful mermaid bathing in a fountain,
sculpted from creamy, faintly pinkish travertine. It glistens softly in the
light, as if sprinkled in actual water.

young halfling

This halfling has been caught by kobolds, and was meant to be roasted and eaten
before you unceremoniously interrupted. Don't you have any manners? Didn't you
ever learn not to disrupt people's meals?

A junior member of the order of spriggans sworn to protect nature. While less

its presence until they find themselves on the wrong end of a quick blade.
%%%%
vampire noble

<vampire>
%%%%
vampire warrior

This vampire, formidable in combat, uses magic only for self-boosts, preferring
hand to hand combat to deal with pesky interlopers.
%%%%
vine covered stone golem

While made of ordinary old weathered stone, covered with moss and vines, this
golem still needs to be respected. It is still hard as stone, after all, and
its weight spells massive damage if it connects a blow.
%%%%
warrior statue

This statue depicts a gruff warrior, wielding a mean two-handed weapon. Since
it appears to be capable of moving its arms, keeping your distance seems to be
the only way to keep your vital organs undamaged.
%%%%
witch

An old and unnaturally ugly human, wearing robes stained with what appears to
be swamp ooze, cauldron soot and brew ingredients.

A magician with such stellar sanity and manners probably has great pets as

This plant lost the war against life-draining influences, and yet its physical

wizard statue

In this land of magic, it'd be foolish to assume that a statue of a wizard is
always an inert piece of rock. This statue's hands and staff have very little
dust compared to the base, suggesting it is capable of making magical gestures.
The trap is too obvious, but dealing with it might not be.
%%%%
zot statue

An utterly bizarre statue, hewn from a single piece of dark gabbro
scintillating with tiny crystals. It is impossible to tell whether the statue

### Meatsprint
bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. It is a
horrendous imitation of the human form, consisting of an unrecognisable mass of
meat stitched together with limbs sewn on seemingly at random. Its skin hangs
off loosely in some places and bulges repulsively in others. Each one bears a
large symbol carved into its flesh, a mark of pride from its twisted creator.
%%%%
large bag of meat

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its
bloated hulk pulsates and throbs constantly with accursed fires. It looks as if
it could explode into a torrent of viscera at any moment.
%%%%
meat berserker

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Its form
is large and muscular. It moves swiftly and with impetuous fury, the sole
thought within its being to rend you apart with great fervour. As it rages, it
creates a cacophonous din.
%%%%
meat hydra

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Each of
its eight necks is distended and elongated, connected to a colossal body
crumpled and dripping with ichor. Its many heads spew blood while writhing and
convulsing in agony, as it brings torment to itself and anything else that
beholds its foul visage.
%%%%
meat beast

One of the legions of abominations created by the sculptors of flesh. Ablaze
with demonic frenzy, it gores and tramples with ferocity unmatched. Its skin is
flayed, exposing the glistening tendons and sinew underneath, and the teeth
inside its cavernous maw are stained with blood.
%%%%
sculptor of flesh

An artisan of unlife, the sculptor appears as a grim skeletal form. It has six
long arms ending in mangled hands with broken fingers, upon which it crawls
like a spider. Its skull is abnormally large and full of holes. Its bones are
reddened and fractured, inscribed with the unholy spells it weaves to assemble
its puppets.
%%%%

The destroyers begin to descend upon you. They come in numbers and with wrath,

%%%%

The accursed are the ones who came before. They have come to ensure you share
their fate.
%%%%
tyrant

A colossal mass of bones and skulls, a walking tomb. You hear shrieks and
screams as it approaches, shattering off bones with each crushing step,
reassembling itself in eternal unrest.
%%%%
dread

An affront to existence, a void in which there is only torment and hellfire.
Its unearthly form is torn and twisted, black and hollow. It is bereft of
rational thought, knowing only hatred and the desire to desecrate your soul.
%%%%
scourge

A vast serpentine form with raw and diseased skin, seeping bile and pus,
spouting venom and blight.
%%%%
observer

You see the unseen, you stare and they stare back. They whisper and laugh, they
grin and cry, they leer at you with contempt and gaze at you in adoration. They

The Meatlord

You behold the embodiment of filth, corruption and depravity, the Meatlord. His
foul body is bloated to the extreme, leaking viscous fluid and the stench of
death. His head is that of a boar with bulging eyes and tusks split in two, his
snout flares and oozes as he snorts and squeals at the sight of you, his mouth
is a toothless rift which drools pools of blood and vomits forth disgusting
remains. His neck is stretched and lops forward, its skin sagging downward. His
immense gut writhes and distorts as the larvae within await their repugnant
release. His legs are unrecognisable masses of flesh, covered in protrusions
and throbbing boils. Your mind reels at the sight of this hideous form and your
senses begin to shut down in an attempt to preserve your sanity as you choke on
the oppressive stench.
%%%%
The Unspeakable

You hear the echoes of planets behind the deafening roar of stars as it
approaches. It is the jaws of the abyss. It brings forth crawling chaos from
within. It is the last sight you will ever see.
