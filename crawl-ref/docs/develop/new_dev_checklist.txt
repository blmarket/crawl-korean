This is a checklist for when a new developer joins the team.

 * Commit rights: add their gitorious account to the dcss-developers group.
 * Add them to CREDITS.txt.
 * Add them to Cheibriados's mailmap, but they're probably already there.
 * Upgrade their mantis account to developer.
 * Update https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:admin:devteam
 * Add them to the committer group on IRC:
     /msg chanserv access ##crawl-dev add NICK committer
   They should first register with NickServ (/msg nickserv help register) to
   prevent others from using that nick.  /whois NICK  will show an "account"
   field if they are registered.
 * Upgrade their CAO, CDO, and CSZO accounts to administrator.  This lets
   them use wizmode, and on CAO and CSZO gives them access to save backups
   and the rebuild trigger:
     dgl admin add <username>
 * Create a WordPress account for them.
 * On the Tavern, add them to the Dungeon Master group.
 * Subscribe their email to c-r-d:
     https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/crawl-ref-discuss
 * Ask |amethyst or edlothiol to add them to the super-secret mailing list.
 * Send an announcement/welcome message on c-r-d.
