 * Add them to CREDITS.txt and to git-hooks/crawl-ref-cia.
 * Upgrade their mantis account to developer.
 * Update https://crawl.develz.org/wiki/doku.php?id=dcss:admin:devteam
 * Add them to the committer group on IRC :
   /msg chanserv access ##crawl-dev add login committer
 * Upgrade their CAO and CDO accounts so that they can use wizmode.
 * On the Tavern, add them to the Dungeon Master group.
 * Subscribe their email to c-r-d:
